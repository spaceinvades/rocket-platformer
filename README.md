_**Rocket Platformer**_

A WIP libGDX Platformer game where you jump with rockets.

Plans:

1. Centered around multiplayer 1v1s
2. All Web-Based
3. 3 Weapons: Rocket (no damage, just for jumping), Plasma Rifle (bouncy!), Rifle (Hitscan)
4. Use a roomcode system like .io games


This is a long project that ive been doing throughout learning to code, so some of it is very sloppy. Sorry.
